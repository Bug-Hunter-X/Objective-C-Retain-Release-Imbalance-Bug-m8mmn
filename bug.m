In Objective-C, a rare but impactful bug can arise from the misuse of the `retain` and `release` methods in manual memory management.  Consider the scenario where an object is retained multiple times without a corresponding release for each retain. This leads to a 'retain count' significantly higher than it should be, preventing the object from being deallocated even when it's no longer needed. This is different from typical memory leaks where an object is never released. This specific issue can only be diagnosed by meticulous examination of the object's retain count and the sequence of retain and release calls throughout its lifecycle.  A simple example would be:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"Deallocating MyClass");
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
        [obj retain]; // Extra retain, not balanced by a release
        [obj retain]; // Extra retain, not balanced by a release
        // ... use the object ...
        [obj release]; // This will leave the retain count at 1
        [obj release]; // Correct release
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, despite calling `release` twice, `obj` won't be deallocated because of the extra retains. This leads to memory leakage, but its root cause is unusual - too many retains.
