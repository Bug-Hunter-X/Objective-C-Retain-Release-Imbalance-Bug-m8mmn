The solution involves carefully reviewing the code to ensure that every `retain` call is balanced with a corresponding `release` call.  Using instruments to trace memory allocations and deallocations is recommended. In the above example, removing the extra `retain` calls will fix the bug.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"Deallocating MyClass");
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
        //Removed extra retains
        // ... use the object ...
        [obj release]; // Correct release
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This corrected version ensures the `retain` count is properly managed, preventing the unexpected persistence of the object.
